# SQL-Challenge

## Project Overview

As part of my role as a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, I successfully completed a research project focusing on employees who were employed during the 1980s and 1990s. The project involved designing a database to manage legacy employee data, importing CSV files into the database, and performing analysis to answer key business questions. This project consisted of three main components:

1. **Data Modeling:** Designing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to model the data
2. **Data Engineering:** Building a database schema and importing data from CSV files into SQL tables
3. **Data Analysis:** Writing and executing SQL queries to analyze the data and generate insights

## Project Components

### Part 1: Data Modeling

* Created an ERD to outline relationships between six tables: `<span>employees</span>`, `<span>departments</span>`, `<span>titles</span>`, `<span>salaries</span>`, `<span>dept_emp</span>`, and `<span>dept_manager</span>`

### Part 2: Data Engineering

* Built database tables with appropriate data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
* Imported data from CSV files into the database using SQL scripts

### Part 3: Data Analysis

* Wrote SQL queries to extract insights such as employee demographics, department managers, hiring trends, and last name frequencies

## Tools and Technologies

* **Database Management System:** PostgreSQL
* **Data Modeling:** QuickDBD (for ERD)
* **Programming Language:** SQL

## Deliverables

* **ERD:** Visual representation of the database structure
* **SQL Scripts:** For schema creation, data import, and analysis queries
